Hey there,

I’m Rizwan, a Computer Science student, based in India.
Who enjoys building backend systems and learning how things work under the hood.
My main tech is Go, C++, ML with Python, focusing on Backend and Data Analytics operations.

I have hands-on experience in Data Science and Machine Learning with Python, during my Internship.

Lately, I’ve been exploring Docker, Linux, and DevOps workflows to understand deployment and scalability better.

If I learn something new or get an idea, I usually try to turn it into a small project and improve it step by step.
