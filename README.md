Hey there,

I’m Rizwan, a Computer Science student who enjoys building backend systems and learning how things work under the hood.

I mostly work with Go and C++, and I like building REST APIs, handling authentication, and designing databases with PostgreSQL and MySQL.

Lately, I’ve been exploring Docker, Linux, and basic DevOps workflows to understand deployment and scalability better.

I’m also learning Data Science and Machine Learning with Python, and I’ve built an NLP-based emotion detection project as part of that journey.

If I learn something new or get an idea, I usually try to turn it into a small project and improve it step by step.
